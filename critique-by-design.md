# Makeover Monday
Graph selected for the redesign: [2022/W35: Top 10 Countries by Military Spending Summary](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2022w35/workspace/project-summary?agentid=makeovermonday&datasetid=2022w35)

I chose this visualization because I liked the topic and aesthetics of the original visualization. Similar to the OECD graphs generalizing government debt I wanted to make a graph that offered comparative data for the U.S. and other countries. 

# Redesign Process

Document your progress as you move forward in your step-by-step process.   
include any insights you gained from the critique method, and what it led you to think about when considering the redesign.  
You should talk about how you moved next to the sketches (include sketches)
any insights you gleaned from your user feedback.  Document what you changed based on the user feedback in your redesign.  (user feedback writeup, avoid identifying info, no full names)
Finally, talk about what your redesigned data visualization shows, why you selected the data visualization you did, and what you attempted to show or do differently. (describe changes)
