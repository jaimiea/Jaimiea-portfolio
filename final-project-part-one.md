# Outline
**Project Summary:**
<br>
To explore my interest in health policy, I wanted to tell a data visualization story about the U.S. healthcare system. I narrowed down my topic to focus on maternal mortality and maternal health disparities. I wanted my story to start more specifically and then conclude on a broader note about U.S. healthcare access and outcomes. It was important to begin by providing the audience with context on the issue's previous and current trends as well as what constitutes maternal death. This includes differences in care and outcomes across race, income, and geography. It was important to portray how this issue influenced long-term outcomes for children and their families. I also wanted to establish important context using statistics and where the U.S. ranks globally for this metric. Offering comparative data allows readers to draw important conclusions.

For the second part of my story, I wanted to delve into the why and the reasons this issue is so prevalent. This involved researching topics such as access to prenatal care, implicit healthcare biases, the impact of socioeconomic factors, causes of maternal mortality, childcare costs, lack of maternity leave, and the influence of COVID-19. Utilizing a diverse data set will allow me to tell a story from an interdisciplinary perspective. I hope to frame my narrative using an economic, public health, and humanistic perspective. For the third part of my project, I focused on a call to action. My goal was to encourage my audience to be educated on the issue and propose policy and community interventions as potential solutions. Ultimately, I wanted my project to draw attention to the disparities and barriers to care facing the U.S. healthcare system.

**Story Structure:**
What I hope to achieve with my visualizations!

**1.) Setup:** 
Despite having the highest healthcare expenditure, maternal mortality remains concerningly high in the U.S. compared to other OECD nations. This issue disproportionately affects low-income women of color.
- Introduce the topic: Maternal Mortality and Health Disparities (Narrow -> Broad)
- Provide context: statistics, important data trends 
- U.S. Maternal Mortality ranking amongst OECD countries
- U.S. ranking for healthcare expenditure amongst OECD nations
- Define maternal mortality
- Include the following statistic, “84% of pregnancy-related deaths are preventable” ([Katella](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/maternal-mortality-on-the-rise), 2023).
- List the main causes of maternal death 
- Portray differences across race, income, geography

**2.) Conflict:**
Maternal mortality continues to rise in the U.S. and highlights the inequalities prevalent in our healthcare system. This has negative implications for U.S. children and families.  Evaluating the cause of this problem requires a look into many underlying factors.
- Data on the impact on children and families
- Social determinants of health and socioeconomic factors (why certain groups are disproportionately affected?) 
- Healthcare implicit biases 
- Discuss access to prenatal and postpartum care 
- Types of preventable death
- Effects of maternity leave 
- Childcare and delivery costs (Itemized hospital bill comparison for U.S. and another OECD country )

**3.) Resolution:**
Understanding and improving this problem requires educated decision-makers to consider how policy interventions and systemic changes can improve maternal health outcomes. 
- Why should the audience care? 
- Call to Action!
  - How they can stay informed (provide links or resources)
  - Advice for concerned pregnant women and women of color 
- Policy interventions
- Building systems to prevent and reduce implicit bias and develop a standardized method of care 
- The broad takeaway: Portraying U.S. healthcare accessibility, disparities, and patient outcomes.
