# Wireframe/Storyboard

**Storyboard Reflection:**
I created my rough draft using Shorthand. I thought it would be a good opportunity to play around with the platform's different features and fleshing out the overall structure of my story. I began by introducing my topic using the points outlined in Part I. The story begins by providing the audience with important context and information on U.S. maternal death trends and causes. In the conflict part of my story, I begin to delve deeper into some of the reasons for these trends. This involved research on topics like paid maternity leave, the maternal workforce, and access to prenatal care. I also incorporated a lot of related images and a video that supported these ideas. My call to action is still coming together. For my draft, I only listed bullet point ideas, potential policy interventions, and resources I would like to include in my final draft. 

**Challenges:**
- I encountered a lot of issues while making this project. There were lots of challenges with my data and Tableau. I would often have to clean up my Excel data or restructure it so that Tableau could interpret it more efficiently. I'm also conflicted by the Tableau graphs since they can only have a white background that looks kind of out of place with my dark Shorthand background. 
- I also encountered some design challenges. For one, it was easy to keep using graph or line graphs for my visualizations. However, I wanted to diversify my data presentations. I would often begin by seeing if my data made it feasible to create certain types of graphs. If the data cooperated I would play around with either Tableau, Datawrapper, or Canva to create a few iterations for each data set. From there I narrowed it down to what I believed was the best version.
- In  my attempt to make more creative visualizations I struggled to make a waffle graph. For my initial sketches, I used this graph type to show comparative data on mandatory paid maternity leave in the U.S., Asia, Australia, and Europe. Unfortunately, after a few online tutorials and a lot of trial and error, I opted to reattempt this graph later. If I cannot find a way to creat a waffle chart using Excel I may utilize a different visualization type for that data set.
