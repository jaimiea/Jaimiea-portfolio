# Storyboard
<script src="https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/u-s-maternal-mortality/embed.js"></script> 

**Reflection:**

I created my rough draft using Shorthand. I thought it would be a good opportunity to play around with the platform's different features and fleshing out the overall structure of my story. I began by introducing my topic using the points outlined in Part I. The story begins by providing the audience with important context and information on U.S. maternal death trends and causes. In the conflict part of my story, I begin to delve deeper into some of the reasons for these trends. This involved research on topics like paid maternity leave, the maternal workforce, and access to prenatal care. I also incorporated a lot of related images and a video that supported these ideas. My call to action is still coming together. For my draft, I only listed bullet point ideas, potential policy interventions, and resources I would like to elaborate on in my final draft.

**Challenges:**
- I encountered a lot of issues while making this project. There were lots of challenges with my data and Tableau. I would often have to clean up my Excel data or restructure it so that Tableau could interpret it more efficiently. I also faced lots of issues when trying to remove whitespace in my graphs. My pie chart still looks a bit cluttered due to the disproportionate spacing. I'm also conflicted by the Tableau graphs since they can only have a white background that looks out of place with my dark Shorthand background. 
- I also encountered some design challenges. Since a lot of my graphs were drawing comparisons or showing trends over time I found it difficult to not use bar or line graphs for my visualizations. However, I wanted to diversify my data presentations. I would often begin by seeing if my data made it feasible to create certain types of graphs. If the data cooperated I would play around with either Tableau, Datawrapper, or Canva to create a few iterations for each data set. From there I narrowed it down to what I believed was the best version.
- In  my attempt to make more creative visualizations I struggled to make a waffle graph. For my initial sketches, I used this graph type to show comparative data on mandatory paid maternity leave in the U.S., Asia, Australia, and Europe. Unfortunately, after a few online tutorials and a lot of trial and error, I opted to reattempt this graph later. If I cannot find a way to create a waffle chart using Excel I may utilize a different visualization type for that data set. 

# User Research 

## Target audience
While I believe this topic is relevant to the general public, my target audience for this project is policymakers (key decision-makers), healthcare workers, U.S. women & families, and public health officials. The factors influencing U.S. maternal mortality and morbidity will ultimately need to be addressed by the target audience I identified. However, the general audience plays a significant role in garnering attention and support for the policy interventions outlined in my draft. This requires providing compelling evidence and a narrative that persuades your audience to not only care about the issue but feel motivated enough to get involved or stay informed. Ultimately, I wanted my final draft to be accessible to all audiences while still maintaining an overall professional tone and jargon.

## Interview script 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|To gauge if the visualizations provided insight into the story being told| 1.) What story do you think the data is telling you?|
|Understand if the story unfolds in a way that's easy to follow and understand|2.) Is the overall structure and flow of the story clear?|
|Evaluate the effectiveness of different design choices I made for my graphs|3.) Please provide specific feedback on the visualizations. What worked? What didn’t? (i.e. titles, use of white space, color choice, etc.)|
|Check if there are any missing story elements or specific areas I should elaborate on|4.) Are there any story elements you feel are missing or could help tell a more compelling story? (i.e. more graphs on geography, more context on a specific topic)|
|Check if the story is compelling, appropriate, and persuasive for the target audience|5.) Who do you think the target audience is?|
|Understand if the main takeaways and recommendations are clear|6.) Is the call to action clear?|

                  
## Interview findings
Since most of my solutions delve into policy interventions, I thought it would be important to interview at least two policy students. I also wanted to ask two women and at least one man to get perspectives from different genders. I think the questions I asked were general and specific enough to gauge if the story was clear for the general public as well as my target audience. Lastly, one of my participants is also an international student. I thought it would be interesting to get an international perspective since a lot of my data discusses OECD trends and draws comparative data between the U.S. and other nations. 

- User A: Woman, Mid-30s, Technology Policy Student,  
- User B: Woman, Early 30s, Early Education Policy Student
- User C: Man, Late 20s, Entertainment Industry Management Student, International student


| Questions               |User A | User B| User C |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Question 1 | The story is telling me that maternal death rates in the U.S. are unnecessarily high and far worse than in most other countries. It shows the need for change and what some of the causes of the situation are. |The point that the data is trying to tell is that maternal mortality rates in the US are very high and there is a lack of a proper system to stop this from happening.|My takeaway from this data is that while we have more technology and wealth than ever before, there are underlying issues in medical care that have caused increased maternal mortality. The issues are racial biases from medical care workers that haven’t been addressed adequately, as well as the resources available to pregnant women.|
| Question 2 | Yes, it is very clear and informational in terms of structure, taking you through all of the questions one would have about the topic.| Yes. The general information in the beginning allows us to understand the problem. Then, we look into more specifics about what is lacking. The end has some mentions about what are some of the first topics to tackle first.| Yes. This follows a very clear story: here is the problem, what caused the problem, and here’s how we can fix it.|
| Question 3 | The visualizations are quite colorful and cohesive. My only real criticism from a visual perspective is that the pale yellow somewhat feels like it clashes with the deeper yellows that come later, and the pink bill, later on, doesn’t seem to match everything as well as the rest of the artwork.| The paid maternity leave graph is a bit too whimsical for such a serious topic. The invoice image makes it harder to see some of the graphs.| U.S. Maternal Mortality Steadily Rises Over Time – I like this graph, it is very easy to read and shows the spike in the U.S. Health Care Expenditure, U.S. vs. Industrialized Countries, Racial Differences - These graphs show the differences very clearly; easy to read and understand graph. Main Causes – Is this graph showing the causes during pregnancy and then within 42 days postpartum, within 43 days to a year postpartum? I like the video; it is such an impactful story that ties together the racial elements at play as well as the lack of maternal care workers. Maybe adding an overall statistic of how many maternal deaths/infant deaths are due to negligence could help because I can also see someone thinking that this is just a freak accident. Negligence and then also how it coincides with race and/or socioeconomic status. I think the graphics and graphs look great; The background looks really cool.|
| Question 4 | No, I think this covers the story quite well and explains the issue in depth.| I think the information is appropriate, but there should be a clearer call to action.| In the Social Determinants section, I wonder if there is a country that is comparable to the United States in terms of racial diversity and socioeconomic status that can be looked at as a model. It would be interesting to see if other places or even cities within the U.S. that have similar demographics compare with one another. The focus is on mothers so it might be cool to see stats on how many think their healthcare is adequate in general, healthcare during pregnancy, and maybe even something about attitudes towards their doctors/healthcare providers and their attitudes toward having more children. |
| Question 5 | I would say the target audience is anyone who cares about the well-being of mothers while pregnant, as well as the general public at large who should know these alarming statistics.| The general public to begin caring more about the topic.| Doctors, hospitals, healthcare providers, insurance companies (maybe), and women's rights activists?|
| Question 6 | I am having trouble figuring out what the call to action is just yet, but I can see where it going.| Although I now understand what the problem is, I do not know what I can do next to help solve the problem.  Perhaps a clearer call to action could enable to reader to be able to do something to help solve the problem. |Yes|
