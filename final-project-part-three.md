# Changes Made Since Part II

## Design Decisions
- Since Part II, I have made several adjustments to my final draft. Utilizing the user feedback, I opted to stick with the same shade of yellow for all my slide colors and heading fonts. This kept my color scheme consistent and easy to design.
- Another design choice I made regarding color was my decision to use dark mode for all my Shorthand slides. I didn't like the contrasting white background in my original Tableau and Canva graphs so I added a black background for each graph and edited the title, grid lines, and axis fonts to a contrasting shade of white.
- Based on my interviews I also wanted to make my call to action more clear and impactful. To accomplish this, I added specific measures and potential policy interventions that can improve U.S. health equity and maternal outcomes. I also linked important resources and further information (using Shorthand's button feature) for individuals who may want to advocate or volunteer on related issues.
- I was able to successfully create the waffle chart after my third attempt. Using Excel I made four 10x10 cubes that allowed me to represent the number of paid maternity leave weeks available in select countries. I particularly like this graph since it shows comparative data without using a typical bar, pie, or line graph.

## Challenges 
- I had to make some tough decisions along the way and couldn't accomplish all the visualizations I initially sketched out in my draft. One challenge I encountered occurred when I changed all my Tableau graphs to a black background. When publishing the edited graphs into Tableau Public a white line appeared under the title. I tried consulting multiple forums and YouTube videos but unfortunately couldn't find a way to get rid of the line and had to keep them in my final designs.
- Another frustrating challenge I encountered was with my data and Tableau. I wanted to make a map graph that showed maternal care deserts across the U.S. and the proportion of uninsured women of reproductive age (18-44 years) across the states. However, I struggled to find a complete set of public data sources that would allow me to utilize the longitude and latitude coordinates in Tableau. Thus, I tried to find other sources I could use to tell a story about the lack of maternal care workers and insurance coverage in the U.S.
- Lastly, in my draft, I originally planned to use an invoice template from Canva to create an itemized invoice for the average U.S. child delivery costs and compare it with an itemized invoice from another country. However, upon further research, I discovered a few challenges with this idea. For one, average child delivery costs vary highly across different states and by delivery method. This makes it difficult to find an accurate average across all of the U.S. Second, I learned that despite countries like Japan having higher birthing costs, they offer much better insurance coverage, postpartum care, and medical leave. As a result, simply telling a story about the high costs of childbirth in the U.S. didn't seem too compelling since it doesn't examine how insurance coverage factors into cost and resource accessibility. 
  
## The Audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

## Presentation Focus
Tell story using setup, conflict, and resolution structure. Select the graph from each section and discuss key points of each section.
